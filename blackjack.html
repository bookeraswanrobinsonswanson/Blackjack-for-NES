                This version of Blackjack was built as a class project using 6502 Assembly for Computer Architecture 2 (CIIC4082) taught by Prof. Juan
                Patarroyo Montenegro at the Universiy
                of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez.
            </p>
            <p>This version is programmed and optimized for FCEUX. You can download it below. </p>

            <h2>How to play:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Press START to start the round and continue the rounds when you win or lose. On FCEUX this is the ENTER button.</li>
                <li>Bet using the D-Pad, left removes all the bets, and right adds all the bets.</li>
                <li>Confirm your bet by pressing A. On FCEUX, this is F.</li>
                <li>Add cards by pressing A, and finish your turn by pressing B. On FCEUX, this is D.</li>
                <li>The dealer then takes cards until their value is greater than or equal to 17, and the game plays as a normally as Blackjack. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You win by getting $1000, and you lose if you lose all your cash.</p>
